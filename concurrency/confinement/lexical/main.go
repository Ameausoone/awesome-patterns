// There are two kinds of confinement possible: ad hoc and lexical.

// Lexical confinement involves using lexical scope to expose only the correct data and
// concurrency primitives for multiple concurrent processes to use. It makes it impossible to do the wrong thing.

// If a goroutine is responsible for creating a goroutine, it is also responsible for ensuring it can stop the goroutine.
