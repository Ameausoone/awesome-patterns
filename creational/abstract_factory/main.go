// The abstact factory pattern is a new layer of grouping to achieve a bigger composit object.
// Which is used through it's interface. The idea behind grouping objects in families and grouping families is to have
// big factory that can be interchangable and can grow more easily.

// NOTICE: you will not likely to apply abstract factory from begining unless you know your object inventory for a specific
// field is going to be large.

// Objectives: Grouping related families of objects is very convenient when your object number is growing so much that
// creating a unique point to get them all seems the only way to gain the flexible of runtime object creation.
